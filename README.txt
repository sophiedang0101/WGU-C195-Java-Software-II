Directions for how to run the program:

   • Launch the application, and a login form will be displayed. The user is required to enter the correct username and password, 
     which will sign them into the application.

   • The login form can be translated into French based on the end-user local machine's language.

   • After logging in, the user will see a navigation screen with three buttons. The first will take them to the main screen, 
     the second will redirect them to the reports screen, and the last will take them back to the login form.

   • If the main views button is clicked, the screen containing appointments and customer tables will be shown. 
     On this page, the user can add, update, and    delete customers and appointments.

   • The user can also click the radio button to view appointments divided by week, month, or all.

   • If the user wants to add, update, or delete a customer or an appointment, they'll be redirected to the customer 
     or appointment form according to which    button they clicked.

   • If the reports button is selected, the user is redirected to the reports screen, where they'll see different reports.

   • If the user selects the login button, they'll be logged out and shown the login screen.


A description of the additional report of your choice you ran in part A3f:

    • One additional custom report of my choice contains the users' schedules. The report shows each user's schedule,
      which includes the appointments' start/end times and attending contact and customer. This report is beneficial
      because it displays all the users' schedules in one place, making it easy to check a user's schedule.

    • A second custom report of my choice contains information on customers by first-level divisions. The table shows each
      first-level division associated with a customer on the left column and the total number of customers with that specific
      first-level division on the right column. This report is useful because it provides information on which area contains the most customers.
